# Homework 1: Code Refactor

I was motivation to finish this project because I want to create accessibility for the many people with disablilties. It's important to provide equal access and equal right during the time we live in. Their were many problems I came across like how to use the sematic HMTL element and styling and positioning the structure for the HTML and CSS. I learned that website's had accessibility for disable people which I never knew.
